In our lives, friendships with animals are taking on a special form.
Firstly, animals engage in various interactions in our daily lives, with the most common being our pets. 
We live closely with our pets, forming deep bonds and coexisting with them.
For instance, we engage in physical activities with our dogs and provide a sense of security to our cats by petting them, allowing us to connect with them.
Therefore, the connection with animals can relieve stress and enhance life satisfaction through relaxation. 
Furthermore, we derive significant emotional support from our pets in life. 
To illustrate this, let's take our familiar canine companions as an example. 
Dogs offer love and loyalty to their owners.
We receive love from our dogs, helping alleviate stress and, for those facing psychological challenges like depression, easing their symptoms, making our lives more comfortable.
At the same time, we develop a closer relationship with our dogs by giving them more love. 
Not only do we connect emotionally, but we also bond through physical activities. 
Walking with our dogs, we increase our physical activity levels, improve our overall health, and bring joy to our canine companions. Nevertheless, readers may still be curious about how we communicate and connect with animals.
Animals exhibit various forms of intelligence and emotions, allowing us to communicate with them in various ways. 
According to research on animal emotions, animals experience a wide range of emotions and can express their empathetic abilities during interactions with humans.
Dogs and cats, for example, use about 300 different behaviors to express their emotions. For instance, dogs wag their tails or lick their owner's face to convey their feelings, while cats may make eye contact or expose their bellies, displaying a variety of behaviors.
These emotional expressions usually occur when they feel comfortable in our presence.
As a result, we understand that we provide animals with a sense of security, and we feel a sense of mutual connection.
In this way, animals demonstrate intelligence and emotions similar to our own, allowing us to derive psychological, social, and emotional benefits from our relationships with them.
Hence, we coexist with animals, mutually benefiting from the positive impact we have on each other.
